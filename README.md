You've been tasked by Plato to ascend up Platos caves to find the ethereal "Thing-in-Itself", defeat its guardian (Immanual Kant), and bring it back to Plato. 

Things this game will include: 

1. Destructable environments 
2. Anything can become sentient (bad potions which an enemy makes sentient will run towards you and throw themselves at you)
3. A complex but fair combat system
4. Compelling and interesting desire-driven AI powered by [Dijkstra Maps!](http://www.roguebasin.com/index.php?title=Dijkstra_Maps_Visualized)
