# Geist
A philosophy-inspired rougelike with Dijkstra-Maps and Unique Mechanics!
Still a WIP, Not even close to being done! You get to watch me drunkenly stumble through learning (or ignoring) proper OOP techniques

The number field around me is a visualization of a [Dijkstra Map](http://www.roguebasin.com/index.php?title=Dijkstra_Maps_Visualized)

## The story 
You've been tasked by Plato to ascend up Platos caves to find the ethereal "Thing-in-Itself", defeat its guardian (Immanual Kant), and bring it back to Plato. 

## Things this game will eventually include: 

1. Destructable environments 
2. Anything can become sentient (bad potions which an enemy makes sentient will run towards you and throw themselves at you)
3. A complex but fair combat system
4. Compelling and interesting desire-driven AI powered by [Dijkstra Maps!](http://www.roguebasin.com/index.php?title=Dijkstra_Maps_Visualized)
5. Living things get weaker as they're injured, and will try to flee
And lots more interesting stuff to come! :)
